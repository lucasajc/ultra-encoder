## Instructions

This is a web application made with Spring + Thymeleaf that enables the conversion of video files of a specific format, not compatible with web standards, to a format that is compatible with web standards.
The application has a web interface that allows the inclusion of a new file and, after the process is completed, allow the user to watch the video on the browser.

### How to run it?

To run the app, access the following URL and add a video of your choice to convert: [https://ultra-encoder.herokuapp.com](https://ultra-encoder.herokuapp.com)

To test with a default file, use the file "test-video.mov" (which is in the root folder of the project).
